# README for WebCrawler Script

## Overview

The `WebCrawler` class in this script is designed for crawling websites and extracting textual content. This crawler can be used for various purposes, including data collection, web scraping, and content analysis.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Crawling**: Utilizes `asyncio` and `playwright` for asynchronous web crawling.
- **Concurrent Tasks**: Supports simultaneous tasks with a customizable concurrency limit.
- **Customizable URL List**: Allows specifying a list of initial URLs or automatically populates it based on search results.
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts and stores text content from visited pages.
- **Link Processing**: Processes links on web pages and queues relevant URLs for crawling.
- **Domain-specific Crawling**: Limits crawling to URLs within the same domain.
- **Content Dumping**: Option to dump extracted content to a file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `playwright` library
- `asyncio` library
- `difflib` and other standard Python libraries

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright asyncio difflib
   ```
2. Ensure necessary Python modules (`web_search`, `file_utils`) are in the same directory or installed.

## Usage

1. Initialize the `WebCrawler` with required parameters:

   ```python
   crawler = WebCrawler(keywords='search keywords', max_concurrent=3, url_list=[], dump_to_file=True)
   ```

2. Start the crawling process:

   ```python
   results = crawler.start_crawling()
   ```

## Configuration

- `keywords`: A list of keywords for filtering relevant links.
- `max_concurrent`: Maximum number of concurrent crawling tasks.
- `url_list`: A list of initial URLs to start crawling from. If empty, initial URLs are populated based on `keywords`.
- `dump_to_file`: If `True`, dumps extracted content to a file.

## Functions

- `start_crawling()`: Initiates the crawling process.
- `start_crawling_async()`: Asynchronous handler for the crawling process.
- `populate_initial_urls()`: Populates the initial URLs based on search results.
- `process_queue()`: Manages the queue of URLs to be processed.
- `process_url()`: Processes a single URL.
- `process_link()`: Processes a single link on a page.
- `efficient_filter()`: Filters links based on keywords.
- `is_similar()`: Checks if the link text is similar to the keywords.
